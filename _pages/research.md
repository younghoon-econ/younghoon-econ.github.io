<span class="indent">"When Export Controls Backfire: Evidence from 2019 Korea-Japan Trade Dispute"</span><br>
<div class="abstract">
  Can export controls backfire, leading to an increase in productivity and exports in the targeted country? I use Korea's response to the 2019 Korea-Japan trade dispute to answer these questions. In 2019, Japan announced export controls on South Korea for national strategic items, leaving enforcement up to Japanese officials. Although no export restrictions were imposed in practice, the potential risk alone triggered substantial changes in Korea's imports, output and exports. Imports from Japan have declined significantly, irrespective of whether the items were directly subject to the export controls. Not only has Korea's output increased, but its exports have also expanded more in sectors where Japan had a larger share of the Korean market. Furthermore, the prices of these exported goods have decreased. Motivated by these empirical findings, I structurally estimate the strength of scale economies in Korea and in other countries, and find evidence of large scale economies. This suggests that export-control induced positive shocks to domestic demand have increased domestic productivity, which in turn has lowered prices and boosted exports.</div><br>

  <p class="abstract">
    How might semiconductor producers respond to the possibility of restricted access to key imported intermediate goods? And how might this response vary across inputs? I use the response from Korean semiconductor producers amid the 2019 Korea-Japan political dispute to answer these questions. In July 2019, Japan announced potential export controls on South Korea for three key semiconductor inputs, leaving implementation to Japanese officials. Although no export restrictions were applied in practice, the announcement itself triggered uncertainty over the global supply chain, leading to drastically different responses from Korean producers across the three targeted inputs. I present a model featuring two adjustment margins&mdash;inventories and global sourcing decisions&mdash;with heterogeneity across inputs in the initial share of sourcing from Japan. I show that the calibrated model matches the heterogeneous patterns across the three inputs, suggesting that these two adjustment margins played an important role in practice. Using the model, I also solve for how Korean producers would have responded had Japan extended its export controls to other key semiconductor inputs. These counterfactual responses align with actual responses, indicating that semiconductor producers feared an extension of Japanese export controls.
